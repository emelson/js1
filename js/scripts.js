var myHobby = "I'm taking this class because I really love to use technology in my classes I teach.  I'm hoping to be able to create the best school music program website in the short future, and also a website for the restaurant my wife works at. Ultimately I would love to make a move out of teaching into web development in the longer future. In the small amount of spare time I have, I love to create digital music as well as play the drums.  I'm also interested in Japanese culture because my wife is from Japan.";
